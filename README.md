My DFS implementation of the RoboMaze Pathfinding challenge #RoboMaze

It's a simple algo, but the challenge was in interfacing with the framework, which only returns three cell visibility of a robot and only accepts three movement control commands (turn left, turn right, move forward).
My solution is in the folder RoboAI/RoboAI.h
